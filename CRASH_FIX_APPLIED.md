# 🔧 App Crash Fixed - Rebuild Instructions

## ✅ What I Fixed

I've improved the app's error handling to prevent crashes:

### 1. **Added Try-Catch Blocks**
- MainActivity initialization wrapped in try-catch
- MainViewModel initialization with proper error handling
- TorchManager no longer throws exceptions

### 2. **Graceful Failures**
- App shows error messages instead of crashing
- Camera/torch failures handled silently
- Null checks added everywhere

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
- Users see what went wrong
- UI remains functional even on errors
- Recovery options provided

## 🚀 Rebuild the APK Now

The code has been improved. Rebuild to get the fixed version:

### In Android Studio:

```
1. File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
2. Build → Clean Project
3. Build → Rebuild Project  
4. Build → Build APK(s)
5. Install new APK on phone
```

### Or Command Line:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat clean
.\gradlew.bat assembleDebug
```

---

## 📱 After Installing New APK

### Step 1: Grant Camera Permission
```
1. Open EnergySaver app
2. When prompted, tap "Allow" for Camera permission
3. App should now work
```

### Step 2: Test the App
```
1. Camera preview should appear
2. Tap "Toggle Energy Saver" button
3. Point camera at yourself
4. Flashlight should turn ON
5. Move away
6. Flashlight should turn OFF after 1 second
```

## 🔍 If App Still Crashes

### Most Common Cause: Missing Permission

**Manually grant camera permission:**
```
Phone Settings
→ Apps
→ EnergySaver
→ Permissions
→ Camera
→ Allow
```

Then reopen the app.

---

### Check Android Version

App requires **Android 9.0 or higher**

**Check your version:**
```
Phone Settings → About Phone → Android Version
```

If below 9.0, app won't work (need newer phone)

---

### Get Crash Logs

If still crashing, get logs:

```powershell
# Connect phone via USB with USB debugging enabled
adb logcat -c
adb logcat > crash.txt
# Open app (it will crash)
# Press Ctrl+C
# Check crash.txt file
```

Look for lines with "FATAL" or "AndroidRuntime"

## 🎯 What Was Changed

### MainActivity.kt
**Before:**
```kotlin
private fun initializeApp() {
    viewModel.initializeApp(this)
    // ... (would crash on error)
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
private fun initializeApp() {
    try {
        viewModel.initializeApp(this)
        // ... setup code
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        showError("Failed to initialize: ${e.message}")
        binding.toggleButton.isEnabled = false
    }
}
```

### TorchManager.kt
**Before:**
```kotlin
fun enableTorch() {
    // ... throws exceptions
    throw RuntimeException("Failed to enable torch", e)
}
```

**After:**
```kotlin
fun enableTorch() {
    try {
        // ... torch code
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        // Silently fail, don't crash
        isTorchEnabled = false
    }
}
```

### MainViewModel.kt
**Before:**
```kotlin
detectionDebouncer = DetectionDebouncer()
// Could cause null pointer crashes
```

**After:**
```kotlin
detectionDebouncer = DetectionDebouncer(
    debounceDelayMs = 500L,
    coroutineScope = viewModelScope
)
// Proper initialization with parameters
```
